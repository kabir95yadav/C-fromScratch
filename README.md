# Learn C — repository "c"

This repository is a learning sandbox to practice C from basics to intermediate topics. Each numbered folder is a self-contained lesson with short examples and exercises.

Learning path (recommended)
1. 01-basics — hello world, compilation basics
2. 02-control-flow — if/else, loops
3. 03-functions — defining and using functions
4. 04-pointers — pointer basics, addresses, dereference
5. 05-strings — C strings and common functions
6. 06-structures — struct usage
7. 07-memory — dynamic allocation (malloc/free)
8. 08-file-io — reading/writing files
9. exercises — practice problems and small projects

How to build
- Run `make` at repo root. Binaries will be placed in `bin/`.
- Or compile single file: `gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 path/to/file.c -o bin/name`

Contributing
- Add new examples in a new folder (09-...).
- Add tests or more exercises in `exercises/`.

Enjoy learning C!
